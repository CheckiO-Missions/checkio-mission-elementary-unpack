        You need to make 2 simple steps: find the 1st, 3rd and the 2nd elements from the end, and then return them as a tuple. 
        Pay attention that in Python the numbering of elements starts with 0, not 1.

        Could you give an illustrative example?
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
        For example, we have a tuple ('a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f', 'g') and we need to find its 1st, 3rd and 2nd elements from the end.
        When counting the elements from the beginning of a tuple - the first element will have the index 0. If counting from the end, the "first" 
        element will have the index "-1", the second - "-2" and so on.<br>
        The code would be as follows:
        <br />
        <br />
        <pre class="brush: python">
elements = ('a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f', 'g')
x = elements[0]
y = elements[2]
z = elements[-2]
        </pre>
        After which x will take the value 'a', y - 'c', z - 'f'.

        How to convert the obtained results into a tuple?
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
        No special actions are required. You can instantly use return.
        <br />
        <br />
        <pre class="brush: python">
def easy_unpack(elements):

    x = elements[0]
    y = elements[2]
    z = elements[-2]
    
    return x, y, z
        </pre>
        Or even simpler:
        <br />
        <br />
        <pre class="brush: python">
def easy_unpack(elements):

    return elements[0], elements[2], elements[-2]
        </pre>
    </div>
</div>
