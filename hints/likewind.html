            You need to make 2 simple steps: find the 1st, 3rd and the 2nd elements from the end, and then return them as a tuple. Pay attention that in Python the numbering of elements starts with 0, not 1.

            Could you give an illustrative example?

            For example, we have a tuple <b class="code">('a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f', 'g')</b> and we need to find its 1st, 3rd and 2nd elements from the end. When counting the elements from the beginning of a tuple - the first element will have the index 0. If counting from the end, the "first" element will have the index "-1", the second - "-2" and so on. The code would be as follows:
        </p>
        <pre class="brush: python">
elements = ('a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f', 'g')
x = elements[0]
y = elements[2]
z = elements[-2]
        </pre>
        <p>
            After which <b class="code">x</b> will take the value <b class="code">'a'</b>, <b class="code">y</b> - <b class="code">'c'</b>, <b class="code">z</b> - <b class="code">'f'</b>.
        </p>

            How to convert the obtained results into a tuple?
        </p>

    <div class="answer">
        <p>
            No special actions are required. You can instantly use <b class="code">return</b>.
        </p>
        <pre class="brush: python">
def easy_unpack(elements: tuple) -> tuple:

    x = elements[0]
    y = elements[2]
    z = elements[-2]
    
    return x, y, z
        </pre>
        <p>
            By the way, it is not necessary to enclose the tuple in parentheses, if there is no danger of confusion it with other variables. The solution may be written even simpler:
        </p>
        <pre class="brush: python">
def easy_unpack(elements: tuple) -> tuple:

    return elements[0], elements[2], elements[-2]
        </pre>
    </div>
</div>
